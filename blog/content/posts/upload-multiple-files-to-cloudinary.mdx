# How To Upload Multiple Files to Cloudinary in Node.js using Promise.all

It has remained something confusing while perusing [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) documentation on how exactly do you upload multiple images. For most developers, what they tend to do is call the single file upload method on the SDK in a loop. While this seems to work at times, it gets buggy when one of the files has to take more time than the other because of the size.

To follow along with this tutorial, you can download the starter boilerplate Node.js with Express code from [GitHub](https://github.com/boyepanthera/multi-file-uploader).

We need to add multer configuration to our `server.js` file, then use this to create an upload middleware function.

## First Acts

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/boyepanthera/multi-file-uploader/blob/master/package.json

# Navigate into the project
cd multi-file-uploader

# Install all dependencies
yarn install

# Install nodemon for server restart on save
yarn add -D nodemon

# Install new dependencies
yarn add dotenv
```

## Second Acts

Add the following scripts object to your package.json :

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node -r esm server.js",
    "dev": "nodemon -r esm server.js"
  }
}
```

What this does is allow us to make our server restart on save and run our JS file with ESM module so we can use import syntax.

## Third Acts: Configure server.js

Update the top part of your server.js file:

```javascript
import express from "express";
import cloudinary from "cloudinary";
import multer from "multer";
import dotenv from "dotenv";

dotenv.config();

const app = express();
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
app.use(express.json());

const {
  NODE_ENV,
  PORT: productionPort,
  IP: productionIP,
  cloudinaryName,
  cloudinaryApiKey,
  cloudinaryApiSecret,
} = process.env;

const storage = multer.diskStorage({
  filename: function (req, file, cb) {
    cb(null, file.fieldname + "-" + Date.now());
  },
});

cloudinary.v2.config({
  cloud_name: cloudinaryName,
  api_key: cloudinaryApiKey,
  api_secret: cloudinaryApiSecret,
});

const upload = multer({ storage });

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  return res.status(200).json({
    message: "Multiple uploader api",
  });
});

// ... rest of your server configuration

if (NODE_ENV === "production") {
  // production configuration
}
```

## Acts Four: The Magic Happens Here

Next, we use the upload middleware function created from multer. This middleware's array method `upload.array(nameOfFilesFields, maxCount)` takes the name we want to call the file field and the maximum number of images it should allow for upload.

```javascript
app.post("/images", upload.array("pictures", 10), async (req, res) => {
  try {
    let pictureFiles = req.files;

    // Check if files exist
    if (!pictureFiles)
      return res.status(400).json({ message: "No picture attached!" });

    // Map through images and create a promise array using cloudinary upload function
    let multiplePicturePromise = pictureFiles.map((picture) =>
      cloudinary.v2.uploader.upload(picture.path)
    );

    // Await all the cloudinary upload functions in promise.all, exactly where the magic happens
    let imageResponses = await Promise.all(multiplePicturePromise);

    res.status(200).json({ images: imageResponses });
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(500).json({
      message: err.message,
    });
  }
});
```

## Testing the Implementation

You can run `yarn dev` - your app should be running on `localhost:9000`

You can make a request to `http://localhost:9000/images` with the form-data request body type using `pictures` as the field name.

## Key Benefits of This Approach

1. **Concurrent Uploads**: All files upload simultaneously instead of sequentially
2. **Better Performance**: Significantly faster than loop-based uploads
3. **Error Handling**: Proper error handling for failed uploads
4. **Scalability**: Can handle multiple files efficiently

## Alternative Approaches

As mentioned in the comments, for production applications with high traffic, consider:

1. **Client-side uploads** using signed URLs
2. **Event-based responses** using WebSockets
3. **Frontend SDKs** for React/Vue applications

These approaches can help prevent server memory issues and improve user experience.

_This tutorial demonstrates a practical solution to a common problem in Node.js applications. The Promise.all approach ensures all uploads happen concurrently, making your application more efficient and reliable._
