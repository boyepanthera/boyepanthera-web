# Building a Modern Portfolio with Next.js

A great portfolio website is essential for any software developer. In this guide, I'll walk through how I built this site using Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js offers several advantages for portfolio sites:

- **Performance**: Automatic code splitting and server-side rendering
- **SEO**: Better search engine visibility with SSR
- **Developer Experience**: Great developer tools and fast refresh
- **Deployment**: Easy deployment with Vercel

## Setting Up the Project

First, I created a new Next.js project:

```bash
npx create-next-app my-portfolio
cd my-portfolio
```

## Adding Dark Mode

One of the key features of my portfolio is the theme switching capability:

```jsx
"use client";

import { createContext, useContext, useState, useEffect } from "react";

const ThemeContext = createContext({
  theme: "light",
  toggleTheme: () => {},
});

export function ThemeProvider({ children }) {
  // Implementation details...
}

export const useTheme = () => useContext(ThemeContext);
```

## Conclusion

Building a portfolio with Next.js provides an excellent opportunity to showcase both your work and your technical skills. The resulting site is fast, SEO-friendly, and visually impressive.
